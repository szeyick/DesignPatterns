Design Patterns
==============

Welcome to the design patterns repository.

This repository contains notes and code examples (included in the projects readMe) on various computing design patterns. Each project is inspired by the text Design Patterns : Elements of Reusable Object-Orientated Software.

The notes and accompanying code examples are a summary and spin on the patterns described in the book. Each code example contains a basic situation where the particular design pattern can be applied.

The code provided is written in Java.
