The Mediator Pattern -

The mediator pattern involves an object that encapsulates how a set of other objects interact. The
pattern promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly and
allows you to vary their interactions independently.

In OO design we are taught to distribute behaviour across objects. Sometimes this can create dependencies
between objects and in the worst case, results in all objects knowing about every other object since
you create a explicit link between the two.

Breaking down a system or functionality into many different objects encourages object reuse however
possible dependencies between the objects can result in a tighter than expected coupling. The tighter
the coupling the harder it may be to extend functionality since it might result in changes across 
many different objects.

The mediator object in the pattern is responsible for controlling and coordinating interactions of a
group of objects. It keeps objects in the group from knowing about each other and acts as the 
intermediary. The objects of the group know about the mediator but nothing of each other.

The objects being interacted tell the mediator that it has been changed, the mediator then gets the
change list from the object and passes it onto somewhere else. The mediator acts as a sort of director
that tells things where to go.
