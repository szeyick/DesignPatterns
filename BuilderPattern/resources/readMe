Builder Pattern -

The intention of the builder pattern is to separate the construction of the object from its representation so that
the same construction process can create different representations of the object.

In other words we want to be able to "build" a particular object with a variety of data without having to modify the object itself. 
The "builder" grabs all the available data and builds the object on behalf of the client. 

It is an object creation algorithm designed to reduce the number of constructors or initialisers that an object will have if it becomes
quite complex. This "many constructors" concept is called telescoping. 

When to use -

- A builder pattern should be used when the algorithm for creating a complex object needs to be independent of the parts that
  make up the object and how they're assembled. 
  
- A builder pattern should be used when we require different ways to construct an object given different sets of data.

Basic Structure -

1. Builder

- The builder defines the abstract interface for creating parts of a "Product" object.

2. Concrete Builder

- The concrete builder constructs and assembles part of the product object.
- The concrete builder implements the builder interface.
- The concrete builder keeps track of the product that it creates
- The concrete builder provides the interface for retrieving the build product.
- The concrete builder takes requests from the director to add parts to the product.
- The concrete builder builds the product on behalf of the director. 

3. Director

- The director constructs the object using the builder interface.
- The director asks the builder to build the object by passing it the data.
- The director is created by the client and configures it to use the desired builder object. 
- The director notifies the builder whenever part of the product should be built.
- The director asks the builder for the product.

4. Product 

- The product is the complex object that is under construction.
- The products internal representation is created by the concrete builder.
- The product also includes classes that define parts of the object, and includes interfaces for assembling into the final object.

Benefits and Drawbacks

- How the product is built is hidden from the client.
- Changing the internal representation of the product will require the builder to be updated.
- Code for building the object and representing the object are isolated. The client won't know anything about the classes that
  are in the product.
  
- Different directors can use the same builder meaning the builder code is only written once. 
- Additional control is given to building objects and can be retrieved only when it is finished. 

Example - 

An example of the builder pattern in use is the buying of a car. When we purchase a car, there are many different options
that it can come with, this is where the builder pattern would be useful. In the counter example of not using an additional
builder to build the car object, to build a car with all its possible combinations, we might end up having a whole heap of 
constructors in the car (product) object. 

Optional extras that come with a car could create a telescopic object meaning that for all possible combinations we'll have 
additional constructors, which might will blow out the size of the object.

So long as the builder is able to provide default values to fill in the gaps for the ones that the director hasn't provided
we will be able to build a complete object by simply calling the setters that we want to change. By moving the set methods
and calling them individually through the builder we remove all the excess telescopic constructors from the product object.

For this car example, our structures are as follows - 

- The builder interface defines the options that are available for a car, it also provides a means to retrieve the finished car.
- The concrete builder is responsible for taking all of the directors instructions on the car to build and its options to builds the car.
- The director can be seen as the car salesman, relaying the instructions for things to build in the car and asks the builder to do it.
- The product is the completed car with all its options.
