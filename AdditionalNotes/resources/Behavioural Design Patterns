Behavioural Design Patterns

These design patterns are concerned with algorithms and how we assign responsibilities between
objects. Along with the patterns of the objects and classes, it is also responsible for describing
how objects communicate with each other. 

Behavioural class patterns use inheritence to distribute behaviour between classes.

Behavioural object patterns use object composition to know about each other.
